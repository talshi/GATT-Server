# GATT-Server
Implementation of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) peripheral using [bleno](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno).

The peripheral supports read and write requests (with or without response).

This project can be used as part of IoT projects, while there is a need to simulate a BLE peripheral.

To install the project, just run:

```
npm install
node ./gatt-server.js
```
